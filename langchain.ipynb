Different from other assays, PROSPERO extends beyond life/death screening by rapidly evaluating acute molecular drug responses at single-cell resolution.\\nRESULTS: The PROSPERO assay was developed by correlating short-term single-cell molecular signatures using mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to long-term cytotoxicity readouts in representative patient-derived glioblastoma cell cultures (n\\u2009=\\u200914) that were exposed to radiotherapy and the small-molecule p53/MDM2 inhibitor AMG232. The predictive model was subsequently projected to evaluate drug activity in freshly resected GBM samples from patients (n\\u2009=\\u200934). Here, PROSPERO revealed an overall limited capacity of tumor cells to respond to therapy, as reflected by the inability to induce key molecular markers upon ex vivo treatment exposure, while retaining proliferative capacity, insights that were validated in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. This approach also allowed the investigation of cellular plasticity, which in PDCLs highlighted therapy-induced proneural-to-mesenchymal (PMT) transitions, while in patients\\' samples this was more heterogeneous.\\nCONCLUSION: PROSPERO provides a precise way to evaluate therapy efficacy by measuring molecular drug responses using specific biomarker changes in freshly resected brain tumor samples, in addition to providing key functional insights in cellular behavior, which may ultimately complement standard, clinical biomarker evaluations.[37171617]BACKGROUND: Functional profiling of freshly isolated glioblastoma (GBM) cells is being evaluated as a next-generation method for precision oncology.

Quiescent cancer stem cells are thought to be responsible for treatment resistance in glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer with poor patient outcomes. However, the regulation of quiescence in glioblastoma cells involves a myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that are not fully understood. In this review, we synthesise the literature on quiescence regulatory mechanisms in the context of glioblastoma and propose an ecological perspective to stemness-like phenotypes anchored to the contemporary concepts of niche theory. From this perspective, the cell cycle regulation is multiscale and multidimensional, where the niche dimensions extend to extrinsic variables in the tumour microenvironment that shape cell fate. Within this conceptual framework and powered by ecological niche modelling, the discovery of microenvironmental variables related to hypoxia and mechanosignalling that modulate proliferative plasticity and intratumor immune activity may open new avenues for therapeutic targeting of emerging biological vulnerabilities in glioblastoma.[37037400]Quiescence is a state of cell cycle arrest, allowing cancer cells to evade anti-proliferative cancer therapies.

Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) promote therapeutic resistance and cellular heterogeneity due to their self-renewal properties and capacity for plasticity. To understand the molecular processes essential for maintaining GSCs, we performed an integrative analysis comparing active enhancer landscapes, transcriptional profiles, and functional genomics profiles of GSCs and non-neoplastic neural stem cells (NSCs). We identified sorting nexin 10 (SNX10), an endosomal protein sorting factor, as selectively expressed in GSCs compared with NSCs and essential for GSC survival. Targeting SNX10 impaired GSC viability and proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced self-renewal capacity. Mechanistically, GSCs utilized endosomal protein sorting to promote platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) proliferative and stem cell signaling pathways through posttranscriptional regulation of the PDGFR tyrosine kinase. Targeting SNX10 expression extended survival of orthotopic xenograft-bearing mice, and high SNX10 expression correlated with poor glioblastoma patient prognosis, suggesting its potential clinical importance. Thus, our study reveals an essential connection between endosomal protein sorting and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and suggests that targeting endosomal sorting may represent a promising therapeutic approach for glioblastoma treatment.[36795488]Glioblastoma is the most malignant primary brain tumor, the prognosis of which remains dismal even with aggressive surgical, medical, and radiation therapies.

However, cases demonstrating pathological features of low-grade glioma (LGG) lead to difficulties in classification and clinical management. We report a series of 8 GB and 14 LGG with FGFR3:TACC3 fusion in order to better characterize them.\\nMETHODS: Centralized pathological examination, search for TERT promoter mutation and DNA-methylation profiling were performed in all cases. Search for prognostic factors was done by the Kaplan-Meir method.\\nRESULTS: TERT promoter mutation was recorded in all GB and 6/14 LGG. Among the 7 cases with a methylation score\\u2009>\\u20090.9 in the classifier (v12.5), 2 were classified as glioblastoma, 4 as ganglioglioma (GG) and 1 as dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). t-SNE analysis showed that the 22 cases clustered into three groups: one included 12 cases close to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype methylation class (MC), 5 cases each clustered with GG or DNET MC but none with PLNTY MC. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed four groups, two of them being clearly distinct: 5 cases shared age (<\\u200940), pathological features of LGG, lack of TERT promoter mutation, FGFR3(Exon 17)::TACC3(Exon 10) fusion type and LGG MC. In contrast, 4 cases shared age (>\\u200940), pathological features of glioblastoma, and were TERT-mutated.

Relevant factors associated with a better prognosis were age\\u2009<\\u200940 and lack of TERT promoter mutation.\\nCONCLUSION: Among gliomas with FGFR3::TACC3 fusion, age, TERT promoter mutation, pathological features, DNA-methylation profiling and fusion subtype are of interest to determine patients\\' risk.[36612140]Diffuse gliomas continue to be an important problem in neuro-oncology. To solve it, studies have considered the issues of molecular pathogenesis from the intratumoral heterogeneity point. Here, we carried out a comparative dynamic analysis of the different cell populations\\' content in diffuse gliomas of different molecular profiles and grades, considering the cell populations\\' functional properties and the relationship with patient survival, using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, multiparametric fluorescent in situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and cultural methods. It was shown that an increase in the IDH-mutant astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas malignancy is accompanied by an increase in stem cells\\' proportion and mesenchymal cell populations\\' appearance arising from oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like cells with cell plasticity and cells\\' hypoxia response programs\\' activation. In glioblastomas, malignancy increase is accompanied by an increase in both stem and definitive cells with mesenchymal differentiation, while proneuronal glioma stem cells are the most likely the source of mesenchymal glioma stem cells, which, in hypoxic conditions, further give rise to mesenchymal-like cells. Clinical confirmation was a mesenchymal-like cell and mesenchymal glioma stem cell number, and the hypoxic and plastic molecular programs\\' activation degree had a significant effect on relapse-free and overall survival. In general, we built a multi-vector model of diffuse gliomas\\' pathogenetic tracing up to the practical plane.[36612140]Diffuse gliomas continue to be an important problem in neuro-oncology.

Current therapies are ultimately ineffective as GBM tumour cells adapt their identity to escape treatment. Recent advances in single-cell epigenetics and transcriptomics highlight heterogeneous cell populations in GBM tumours originating from unique cancerous genetic aberrations. However, they also suggest that tumour cells conserve molecular properties of parent neuronal cells, with their permissive epigenetic profiles enabling them to morph along a finite number of reprogramming routes to evade treatment. Here, we review the known tumourigenic, neurodevelopmental and brain-injury boundaries of GBM plasticity, and propose that effective treatment of GBM requires the addition of therapeutics that restrain GBM plasticity.[36460606]Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most lethal primary brain cancer largely due to recurrence of treatment-resistant disease.

In recent years, the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been recognized as an important player and therapeutic target in GBM. However, there is a need for a full and integrated understanding of the different cellular and molecular components involved in the GBM TME and their interactions for the development of more efficient therapies. In this review, we provide a comprehensive report of the GBM TME, which assembles the contributions of physicians and translational researchers working on brain tumor pathology and therapy in France. We propose a holistic view of the subject by delineating the specific features of the GBM TME at the cellular, molecular, and therapeutic levels.[36400694]Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most deadly type of malignant brain tumor, despite extensive molecular analyses of GBM cells.

Metabolism being an obligatory step in shaping cell behavior, we looked for metabolic weaknesses shared by motile cells across the diverse genetic contexts of patients\\' glioblastoma. Computational analyses of single-cell transcriptomes from thirty patients\\' tumors isolated cells with high motile potential and highlighted their metabolic specificities. These cells were characterized by enhanced mitochondrial load and oxidative stress coupled with mobilization of the cysteine metabolism enzyme 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). Functional assays with patients\\' tumor-derived cells and -tissue organoids, and genetic and pharmacological manipulations confirmed that the cells depend on enhanced ROS production and MPST activity for their motility. MPST action involved protection of protein cysteine residues from damaging hyperoxidation. Its knockdown translated in reduced tumor burden, and a robust increase in mice survival. Starting from cell-by-cell analyses of the patients\\' tumors, our work unravels metabolic dependencies of cell malignancy maintained across heterogeneous genomic landscapes.[36310164]Cell motility is critical for tumor malignancy.

The inherently cold tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in gliomas, characterized by a high ratio of pro-tumor to anti-tumor immune cell infiltrates, acts as a seemingly insurmountable barrier to immunotherapy. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) within these tumors are key contributors to this cold TIME, often functioning indirectly through activation and recruitment of pro-tumor immune cell types. Furthermore, drivers of GSC plasticity and heterogeneity (e.g., reprogramming transcription factors, epigenetic modifications) are associated with induction of immunosuppressive cell states. Recent studies have identified GSC-intrinsic mechanisms, including functional mimicry of immune suppressive cell types, as key determinants of anti-tumor immune escape. In this review, we cover recent advancements in our understanding of GSC-intrinsic mechanisms that modulate GSC-TIME interactions and discuss cutting-edge techniques and bioinformatics platforms available to study immune modulation at high cellular resolution with exploration of both malignant (i.e., GSC) and non-malignant (i.e., immune) cell fractions. Finally, we provide insight into the therapeutic opportunities for targeting immunomodulatory GSC-intrinsic mechanisms to potentiate immunotherapy response in gliomas.[36212415]Despite its growing use in cancer treatment, immunotherapy has been virtually ineffective in clinical trials for gliomas.

GB cells are exposed to various stimuli from the tumor microenvironment and acquire the potential to resist chemoradiotherapy. To investigate how GB cells acquire stem cell-like phenotypes, we focused on ribosomal proteins, because ribosome incorporation has been reported to induce stem cell-like phenotypes in somatic cells. Furthermore, dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis has been reported in several types of cancer. We focused on ribosomal protein S6, which promotes sphere-forming ability and stem cell marker expression in GB cells. We expect that investigation of dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and extra-ribosomal function in GB will provide new insights about the plasticity, heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance of GB cells, which can potentially lead to revolutionary therapeutic strategies.[35508789]The characteristic features of plasticity and heterogeneity in glioblastoma (GB) cells cause therapeutic difficulties.

Mitochondrial morphology is associated with the metabolic plasticity of GBM cells. Previous studies have revealed distinct mitochondrial morphologies and metabolic phenotypes between GSCs and non-stem tumor cells (NSTCs), whereas the molecules regulating mitochondrial dynamics in GBM cells are largely unknown. Herein, we report that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is preferentially expressed in NSTCs, and governs mitochondrial dynamics and GSC differentiation. Expressions of CPT1A and GSC marker CD133 were mutually exclusive in human GBMs. Overexpression of CPT1A inhibited GSC self-renewal but promoted mitochondrial fusion. In contrast, disruption of CPT1A in NSTCs promoted mitochondrial fission and reprogrammed NSTCs toward GSC feature. Mechanistically, CPT1A overexpression increased the phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 at Ser-637 to promote mitochondrial fusion. In vivo, CPT1A overexpression decreased the percentage of GSCs, impaired GSC-derived xenograft growth and prolonged tumor-bearing mice survival. Our work identified CPT1A as a critical regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and GSC differentiation, indicating that CPT1A could be developed as a molecular target for GBM cell-differentiation strategy.[34963686]Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are self-renewing tumor cells with multi-lineage differentiation potential and the capacity of construct glioblastoma (GBM) heterogenicity.

Phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity of GIC is an important limitation to therapeutic approaches targeting cancer stem cells. Plasticity also presents a challenge to the identification, isolation, and propagation of purified cancer stem cells. Here we use a barcode labelling approach of GIC to generate clonal populations over a number of passages, in combination with phenotyping using the established stem cell markers CD133, CD15, CD44, and A2B5. Using two cell lines derived from isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma, we identify a remarkable heterogeneity of the phenotypes between the cell lines. During passaging, clonal expansion manifests as the emergence of a limited number of barcoded clones and a decrease in the overall number of clones. Dual-labelled GIC are capable of forming traceable clonal populations which emerge after as few as two passages from mixed cultures and through analyses of similarity of relative proportions of 16 surface markers we were able to pinpoint the fate of such populations. By generating tumour organoids we observed a remarkable persistence of dominant clones but also a significant plasticity of stemness marker expression. Our study presents an experimental approach to simultaneously barcode and phenotype glioma-initiating cells to assess their functional properties, for example to screen newly established GIC for tumour-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities.[34782726]The phenotype of glioma-initiating cells (GIC) is modulated by cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors.

To address this, here we performed multiomics single-cell profiling-integrating DNA methylation, transcriptome and genotype within the same cells-of diffuse gliomas, tumors characterized by defined transcriptional cell state diversity. Direct comparison of the epigenetic profiles of distinct cell states revealed key switches for state transitions recapitulating neurodevelopmental trajectories and highlighted dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis. We further developed a quantitative framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples. We demonstrated heritability of malignant cell states, with key differences in hierarchal and plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, respectively. This work provides a framework anchoring transcriptional cancer cell states in their epigenetic encoding, inheritance and transition dynamics.[34594037]Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed extensive transcriptional cell state diversity in cancer, often observed independently of genetic heterogeneity, raising the central question of how malignant cell states are encoded epigenetically.

Despite intensive research over the past 50 years, little advance has been made to improve the poor outcome, with an overall median survival of 14.6 months following standard treatment. Local recurrence is inevitable due to the quiescent cancer stem cells (CSCs) in GB that co-express stemness-associated markers and components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The dynamic and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a fundamental role in tumor development, progression, invasiveness, and therapy resistance. There is increasing evidence showing the critical role of the RAS in the TME influencing CSCs via its upstream and downstream pathways. Drugs that alter the hallmarks of cancer by modulating the RAS present a potential new therapeutic alternative or adjunct to conventional treatment of GB. Cerebral and GB organoids may offer a cost-effective method for evaluating the efficacy of RAS-modulating drugs on GB. We review the nexus between the GB TME, CSC niche, and the RAS, and propose re-purposed RAS-modulating drugs as a potential therapeutic alternative or adjunct to current standard therapy for GB.[34439159]Glioblastoma (GB) is an aggressive primary brain tumor.

We hypothesize that one main reason for this translational gap is that current cancer models are inadequate. Most models lack the tumor-stroma interactions, which are essential for proper representation of cancer complexed biology. Therefore, we recapitulated the tumor heterogenic microenvironment by creating fibrin glioblastoma bioink consisting of patient-derived glioblastoma cells, astrocytes, and microglia. In addition, perfusable blood vessels were created using a sacrificial bioink coated with brain pericytes and endothelial cells. We observed similar growth curves, drug response, and genetic signature of glioblastoma cells grown in our 3D-bioink platform and in orthotopic cancer mouse models as opposed to 2D culture on rigid plastic plates. Our 3D-bioprinted model could be the basis for potentially replacing cell cultures and animal models as a powerful platform for rapid, reproducible, and robust target discovery; personalized therapy screening; and drug development.[34407932]Many drugs show promising results in laboratory research but eventually fail clinical trials.

This is due to cellular heterogeneity, especially the presence of stemness-related cells, i.e. Cancer Stem Cells (CSC). Previous studies focused on autophagy and its role in CSCs maintenance; these studies gave conflicting results as they reported either sustaining or disruptive effects. In the present work, we silenced two autophagy related genes -either Beclin1 or ATG5- by shRNA and we explored the ensuing consequences on CSCs markers\\' expression and functionalities. Our results showed that the down regulation of autophagy led to enhancement in expression of CSCs markers, while proliferation and clonogenicity were boosted. Temozolomide (TMZ) treatment failed to induce apoptotic death in shBeclin1-transfected cells, contrary to control. We optimized the cellular subset analysis with the use of Sedimentation Field Flow Fractionation, a biological event monitoring- and cell sorting-dedicated technique. Fractograms of both shBeclin1 and shATG5 cells exhibited a shift of elution peak as compared with control cells, showing cellular dispersion and intrinsic sub-fraction modifications. The classical stemness fraction (i.e. F3) highlighted data obtained with the overall cellular population, exhibiting enhancement of stemness markers and escape from dormancy. Our results contributed to illustrate CSCs polydispersity and to show how these cells develop capacity to bypass autophagy inhibition, thanks to their acute adaptability and plasticity.[34314381]Therapeutic resistance and infiltrative capacities justify the aggressiveness of glioblastoma.

With the recent success of immunotherapy in other aggressive cancers such as advanced melanoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma has been brought to the forefront of immunotherapy research. Resistance to therapy has been a major challenge across a multitude of experimental candidates and no immunotherapies have been approved for glioblastoma to-date. Intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, an inherently immunosuppressive environment and tumor plasticity remain barriers to be overcome. Moreover, the unique tissue-specific interactions between the central nervous system and the peripheral immune system present an additional challenge for immune-based therapies. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence that these challenges may be overcome, and immunotherapy continues to be actively pursued in glioblastoma. Herein, we review the primary ongoing immunotherapy candidates for glioblastoma with a focus on immune checkpoint inhibitors, myeloid-targeted therapies, vaccines and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapies. We further provide insight on mechanisms of resistance and how our understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way for more effective immunotherapeutics against glioblastoma.[34054867]Glioblastoma is a highly lethal brain cancer with a median survival rate of less than 15 months when treated with the current standard of care, which consists of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) were developed to target the hypoxic regions of these tumors. Among 2nd generation HAPs, Evofosfamide (Evo, also known as TH-302) exhibits preclinical and clinical activities against adult glioblastoma. In this study, we evaluated its potential in the field of pediatric neuro-oncology. We assessed the efficacy of Evo in vitro as a single drug, or in combination with SN38, doxorubicin, and etoposide, against three pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) and three diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cell lines under hypoxic conditions. We also investigated radio-sensitizing effects using clonogenic assays. Evo inhibited the growth of all cell lines, mainly under hypoxia. We also highlighted a significant synergism between Evo and doxorubicin, SN38, or etoposide. Finally, Evo radio-sensitized the pHGG cell line tested, both with fractionated and single-dose irradiation schedules. Altogether, we report here the first preclinical proof of evidence about Evofosfamide efficiency against hypoxic pHGG and DIPG cells. Since such tumors are highly hypoxic, and Evo potentiates the effect of ionizing radiation and chemotherapy, it appears as a promising therapeutic strategy for children with brain tumors.[33918823]Hypoxia is a hallmark of many solid tumors and is associated with resistance to anticancer treatments.

Of brain tumors, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant glioma and has a dismal prognosis, with only about 5% of patients alive five years after diagnosis. While advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies are rapidly improving outcomes in a variety of other cancers, the standard of care for GBM has largely remained unaltered since 2005. There are many well-studied challenges that are either unique to brain tumors (i.e., blood-brain barrier and immunosuppressive environment) or amplified within GBM (i.e., tumor heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels, plasticity, and cancer stem cells) that make this disease particularly difficult to treat. While we touch on all these concepts, the focus of this review is to discuss the immense inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and advances in our understanding of tumor cell plasticity and epigenetics in GBM. With each improvement in technology, our understanding of the complexity of tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity improves and we gain more clarity on the causes underlying previous therapeutic failures. However, these advances are unlocking new therapeutic opportunities that scientists and physicians are currently exploiting and have the potential for new breakthroughs.[33640445]Brain tumors remain one of the most difficult tumors to treat and, depending on the diagnosis, have a poor prognosis.

The presence of highly therapy-resistant GBM cell subpopulations within the tumor mass, rapid invasion into brain tissues and reciprocal interactions with stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment contributes to an inevitable fatal prognosis for the patients. We highlight the most recent evidence of GBM cell crosstalk with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which occurs either by direct cell-cell interactions via gap junctions and microtubules or cell fusion. MSCs and GBM paracrine interactions are commonly observed and involve cytokine signaling, regulating MSC tropism toward GBM, their intra-tumoral distribution, and immune system responses. MSC-promoted effects depending on their cytokine and receptor expression patterns are considered critical for GBM progression. MSC origin, tumor heterogeneity and plasticity may also determine the outcome of such interactions. Kinins and kinin-B1 and -B2 receptors play important roles in information flow between MSCs and GBM cells. Kinin-B1 receptor activity favors tumor migration and fusion of MSCs and GBM cells. Flow and image (tissue) cytometry are powerful tools to investigate GBM cell and MSC crosstalk and are applied to analyze and characterize several other cancer types.[33438373]Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most malignant and devastating brain tumors. The presence of highly therapy-resistant GBM cell subpopulations within the tumor mass, rapid invasion into brain tissues and reciprocal interactions with stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment contributes to an inevitable fatal prognosis for the patients. We highlight the most recent evidence of GBM cell crosstalk with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which occurs either by direct cell-cell interactions via gap junctions and microtubules or cell fusion. MSCs and GBM paracrine interactions are commonly observed and involve cytokine signaling, regulating MSC tropism toward GBM, their intra-tumoral distribution, and immune system responses. MSC-promoted effects depending on their cytokine and receptor expression patterns are considered critical for GBM progression. MSC origin, tumor heterogeneity and plasticity may also determine the outcome of such interactions.

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor, has served as a platform for the study of CSCs. In addition to illustrating the complexities of CSC biology, these investigations have led to a deeper understanding of GBM pathogenesis, revealed novel therapeutic targets, and driven innovation towards the development of next-generation therapies. While there continues to be an expansion in our knowledge of how CSCs contribute to GBM progression, opportunities have emerged to revisit this conceptual framework. In this review, we will summarize the current state of CSCs in GBM using key concepts of evolution as a paradigm (variation, inheritance, selection, and time) to describe how the CSC state is subject to alterations of cell intrinsic and extrinsic interactions that shape their evolutionarily trajectory. We identify emerging areas for future consideration, including appreciating CSCs as a cell state that is subject to plasticity, as opposed to a discrete population. These future considerations will not only have an impact on our understanding of this ever-expanding field but will also provide an opportunity to inform future therapies to effectively treat this complex and devastating disease.[33173943]Cellular heterogeneity is a hallmark of advanced cancers and has been ascribed in part to a population of self-renewing, therapeutically resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs).

The disease has been stratified into distinct molecular subtypes; however, the underlying regulatory circuitry that gives rise to such heterogeneity and its implications for therapy remain unclear. We developed a modular computational pipeline, Integrative Modeling of Transcription Regulatory Interactions for Systematic Inference of Susceptibility in Cancer (inTRINSiC), to dissect subtype-specific regulatory programs and predict genetic dependencies in individual patient tumors. Using a multilayer network consisting of 518 transcription factors (TFs), 10,733 target genes, and a signaling layer of 3,132 proteins, we were able to accurately identify differential regulatory activity of TFs that shape subtype-specific expression landscapes. Our models also allowed inference of mechanisms for altered TF behavior in different GBM subtypes. Most importantly, we were able to use the multilayer models to perform an\\xa0in silico\\xa0perturbation analysis to infer differential genetic vulnerabilities across GBM subtypes and pinpoint the MYB family member MYBL2 as a drug target specific for the Proneural subtype.[32974985]Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant form of cancer that lacks effective treatment options or well-defined strategies for personalized cancer therapy.

The treatment of GBM is a combination of surgery (when possible), chemotherapy (usually Temozolomide, TMZ) and radiotherapy (RT). However, despite this heavy treatment, GBM invariably recur and the median length of survival following diagnosis is 12 to 15 months, with less than 10% of people surviving longer than five years. GBM is extremely resistant to most treatments because of its heterogeneous nature, which is associated with extreme clonal plasticity and the presence of cancer stem cells, refractory to TMZ- and RT-induced cell death. In this review, we explore the mechanisms by which cancer cells, and especially GBM, can acquire resistance to treatment. We describe and discuss the concept of persister/tolerant cells that precede and/or accompany the acquisition of resistance. Persister/tolerant cells are cancer cells that are not eliminated by treatment(s) because of different mechanisms ranging from dormancy/quiescence to senescence. We discuss the possibility of targeting these mechanisms in new therapeutic regimen.[35582442]Glioblastoma (GBM) represents the main form of brain tumors in adults, and one of the most aggressive cancers overall.

The ability of current tumor models to recapitulate the cellular states found in primary tumors remains unexplored. To address this issue, we compared single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor cells from 5 patients across four patient-specific glioblastoma stem cell (GSC)-derived model types, including glioma spheres, tumor organoids, glioblastoma cerebral organoids (GLICO), and patient-derived xenografts. We find that GSCs within the GLICO model are enriched for a neural progenitor-like cell subpopulation and recapitulate the cellular states and their plasticity found in the corresponding primary parental tumors. These data demonstrate how the contribution of a neuroanatomically accurate human microenvironment is critical and sufficient for recapitulating the cellular states found in human primary GBMs, a principle that may likely apply to other tumor models. SIGNIFICANCE: It has been unclear how well different patient-derived GBM models are able to recreate the full heterogeneity of primary tumors. Here, we provide a complete transcriptomic characterization of the major model types. We show that the microenvironment is crucial for recapitulating GSC cellular states, highlighting the importance of tumor-host cell interactions.[32253265]Glioblastoma (GBM), an incurable tumor, remains difficult to model and more importantly to treat due to its genetic/epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity across cellular states.

Here, we use an integrative approach spanning single-cell RNA-sequencing of 28 tumors, bulk genetic and expression analysis of 401 specimens from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), functional approaches, and single-cell lineage tracing to derive a unified model of cellular states and genetic diversity in glioblastoma. We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in four main cellular states that recapitulate distinct neural cell types, are influenced by the tumor microenvironment, and exhibit plasticity. The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers.[31327527]Diverse genetic, epigenetic, and developmental programs drive glioblastoma, an incurable and poorly understood tumor, but their precise characterization remains challenging.

Here we report that cells expressing CSC-associated cell membrane markers in Glioblastoma (GBM) do not represent a clonal entity defined by distinct functional properties and transcriptomic profiles, but rather a plastic state that most cancer cells can adopt. We show that phenotypic heterogeneity arises from non-hierarchical, reversible state transitions, instructed by the microenvironment and is\\xa0predictable by mathematical modeling. Although functional stem cell properties were similar in vitro, accelerated reconstitution of heterogeneity provides a growth advantage in vivo, suggesting that tumorigenic potential is linked to intrinsic plasticity rather than CSC multipotency. The capacity of any given cancer cell to reconstitute tumor heterogeneity cautions against therapies targeting CSC-associated membrane epitopes. Instead inherent cancer cell plasticity emerges as a novel relevant target for treatment.[30992437]The identity and unique capacity of cancer stem cells (CSC) to drive tumor growth and resistance have been challenged in brain tumors.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to investigate the regulatory mechanisms for different GBM subsets and identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets relevant in the context of GBM-specific niches. The DHHC family of proteins is associated tightly with the malignant development and progression of gliomas. However, the role of these proteins in the plasticity of GBM subsets remains unclear.\\nMETHODS: This study utilized human glioma proneural or mesenchymal stem cells as indicated. The effects of DHHC proteins on different GBM subsets were investigated through in vitro and in vivo assays (i.e., colony formation assay, flow cytometry assay, double immunofluorescence, western blot, and xenograft model). Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, and liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer-mass spectrometry assays were used to detect the protein complexes of ZDHHC18 and ZDHHC23 in various GBM subtypes, and explore the mechanism of DHHC proteins in targeting different subsets of GSCs in specific niches.\\nRESULTS: ZDHHC18 and ZDHHC23 could target the glioma stem cells of different GBM subsets in the context of their specific niches and regulate the cellular plasticity of these subtypes. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that ZDHHC18 and ZDHHC23 competitively interact with a BMI1 E3 ligase, RNF144A, to regulate the polyubiquitination and accumulation of BMI1. These events contributed to the transition of glioma stem cells in GBM and cell survival under the stressful tumor microenvironment.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work highlights the role of DHHC proteins in the plasticity of GBM subsets and reveals that BMI1 represents a potential therapeutic target for human gliomas.[30658672]BACKGROUND: Glioblastomas (GBM) comprise different subsets that exhibit marked heterogeneity and plasticity, leading to a lack of success of genomic profiling in guiding the development of precision medicine approaches against these tumors.

GBM is characterized by poor survival and remarkably high tumors heterogeneity (both intertumoral and intratumoral), and lack of effective therapies. Recent high-throughput data revealed heterogeneous genetic/genomic/epigenetic features and led to multiple methods aiming to classify tumors according to the key molecular events that drive the most aggressive cellular components so that targeted therapies can be developed for individual subtypes. However, GBM molecular subtypes have not led to improvement of patients outcomes. Targeted or tailored therapies for specific mutations or subtypes largely failed due to the complexities arising from intratumoral molecular heterogeneity. Most tumors develop resistance to treatment and soon recur. GBM stem cells (GSCs) have been identified. Recent single cell sequencing studies of GBM suggest that intratumoral cellular heterogeneity can be partially explained by tumor cell hierarchy arising from GBM stem cells. Therefore, the molecular subtypes based on patient derived GSCs may potentially lead to more effective subtype-specific treatments. In this paper, we review the molecular alterations of GBM and molecular subtyping methods as well as subtype plasticity in primary and recurrent tumors emphasizing the clinical relevance of potential targets for further drug development.[30031763]Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common form of brain cancer in adults.

The recurrence is caused by re-growing cell populations such as glioma stem cells (GSCs), suggesting that GSC populations should be targeted. This study addressed whether a novel anti-cancer drug, OTS964, an inhibitor for T-LAK cell originated protein kinase (TOPK), is effective in reducing the size of the heterogeneous GSC populations, a power-law coded heterogeneous GSC populations consisting of glioma sphere (GS) clones, by detailing quantitative growth properties. We found that OTS964 killed GS clones while suppressing the growth of surviving GS clones, thus identifying clone-eliminating and growth-disturbing efficacies of OTS964. The efficacies led to a significant size reduction in GS populations in a dose-dependent manner. The surviving GS clones reconstructed GS populations in the following generations; the recovery of GS populations fits a recurrence after the chemotherapy. The recovering GS clones resisted the clone-eliminating effect of OTS964 in sequential exposure during the growth recovery. However, surprisingly, the resistant properties of the recovered-GS clones had been plastically canceled during self-renewal, and then the GS clones had become re-sensitive to OTS964. Thus, OTS964 targets GSCs to eliminate them or suppress their growth, resulting in shrinkage of the power-law coded GSC populations. We propose a therapy focusing on long-term control in recurrence of glioblastoma via reducing the size of the GSC populations by OTS964.[29423027]Glioblastoma resists chemoradiotherapy, then, recurs to be a fatal space-occupying lesion.

We analyzed the characteristics of 17 adult patients with cGBM and compared them to a series of 103 patients presenting a supra-tentorial glioblastoma (stGBM). The mean age at GBMc diagnosis was 53.4\\xa0years (range 28-77). A history of neurofibromatosis type I was noted in 3 patients. cGBM were hemispheric in 10 patients (58.8%), only vermian in 4 patients (23.5%), and both vermian and hemispheric in 3 patients (17.7%). A H3 K27M mutation was identified in 3/14 patients, a TERT promoter mutation in 3/14 patients and a methylated MGMT promoter in 3/14 patients. None of the patients (0/14) harbored an EGFR amplification, an IDH or a BRAF mutation. Association with neurofibromatosis type I and H3K27M mutations were mutually exclusive. Compared with stGBM, cGBM occurred in younger patients (53.4 vs. 63.2, p\\u2009=\\u20090.02), were more frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type I (18 vs. 1%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.009) and with a H3 K27M mutation (21 vs. 3%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.02). They also tended to have a more frequent multifocal presentation at diagnosis (21 vs. 4.3%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.06), more frequently resulted in leptomeningeal or intra-axial metastasis (44.5 vs. 5%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.002) and were associated with a shorter median overall survival (5.9 vs. 14.2 months, p\\u2009=\\u20090.004). The present study suggests that adult cGBM differ from their supra-tentorial counterpart and constitute a heterogeneous group of IDH wild-type gliomas with at least two subgroups, one associated with H3K27M mutations and the other with neurofibromatosis type I.[29196927]Adult cerebellar glioblastomas (cGBM) are rare and their characteristics remain to be fully described.

Understanding the mechanisms for gliomagenesis, tumor stem/progenitor cell propagation and phenotypic diversity is critical for devising effective and targeted therapy for this lethal disease.

The dismal prognosis is largely attributed to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor, which in addition to intrinsic molecular and genetic changes is also influenced by the microenvironmental niche in which the glioma cells reside. The cancer stem cells (CSCs) hypothesis suggests that all cancers arise from CSCs that possess the ability to self-renew and initiate tumor formation. CSCs reside in specialized niches where interaction with the microenvironment regulates their stem cell behavior. The reciprocal interaction between glioma stem cells (GSCs) and cells from the microenvironment, such as endothelial cells, immune cells, and other parenchymal cells, may also promote angiogenesis, invasion, proliferation, and stemness of the GSCs and be likely to have an underappreciated role in their responsiveness to therapy. This crosstalk may also promote molecular transition of GSCs. Hence the inherent plasticity of GSCs can be seen as an adaptive response, changing according to the signaling cue from the niche. Given the association of GSCs with tumor recurrence and treatment sensitivity, understanding this bidirectional crosstalk between GSCs and its niche may provide a framework to identify more effective therapeutic targets and improve treatment outcome.[28630875]Glioblastoma is the most aggressive cancer of the brain.

Among others, an immature subpopulation of self-renewing and therapy-resistant tumor cells-often referred to as glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs)-has been shown to contribute to disease recurrence. To target these cells personalized immunotherapy has gained a lot of interest, e.g. by reactivating pre-existing anti-tumor immune responses against GSC antigens. To identify T cell targets commonly presented by GSCs and their differentiated counterpart, we used a proteomics-based separation of GSC proteins in combination with a T cell activation assay. Altogether, 713 proteins were identified by LC-ESI-MS/MS mass spectrometry. After a thorough filtering process, 32 proteins were chosen for further analyses. Immunogenicity of corresponding peptides was tested ex vivo. A considerable number of these antigens induced T\\xa0cell responses in GBM patients but not in healthy donors. Moreover, most of them were overexpressed in primary GBM and also highly expressed in recurrent GBM tissues. Interestingly, expression of the most frequent T\\xa0cell target antigens could also be confirmed in quiescent, slow-cycling GSCs isolated in high purity by the DEPArray technology. Finally, for a subset of these T cell target antigens, an association between expression levels and higher T cell infiltration as well as an increased expression of positive immune modulators was observed. In summary, we identified novel immunogenic proteins, which frequently induce tumor-specific T\\xa0cell responses in GBM patients and were also detected in vitro in therapy-resistant quiescent, slow-cycling GSCs. Stable expression of these T cell targets in primary and recurrent GBM support their suitability for future clinical use.[28332095]Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor and still remains incurable.

In summary, we identified novel immunogenic proteins, which frequently induce tumor-specific T\\xa0cell responses in GBM patients and were also detected in vitro in therapy-resistant quiescent, slow-cycling GSCs. Stable expression of these T cell targets in primary and recurrent GBM support their suitability for future clinical use.[28109792]Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor. The heterogeneity at the cellular level, metabolic specificities and plasticity of the cancer cells are a challenge for glioblastoma treatment. Identification of cancer cells endowed with stem properties and able to propagate the tumor in animal xenografts has opened a new paradigm in cancer therapy. Thus, to increase efficacy and avoid tumor recurrence, therapies need to target not only the differentiated cells of the tumor mass, but also the cancer stem-like cells. These therapies need to be effective on cells present in the hypoxic, slightly acidic microenvironment found within tumors. Such a microenvironment is known to favor more aggressive undifferentiated phenotypes and a slow-growing \"quiescent state\" that preserves the cells from chemotherapeutic agents, which mostly target proliferating cells. Based on these considerations, we performed a differential screening of the Prestwick Chemical Library of approved drugs on both proliferating and quiescent glioblastoma stem-like cells and identified bisacodyl as a cytotoxic agent with selectivity for quiescent glioblastoma stem-like cells. In the present study we further characterize bisacodyl activity and show its efficacy in vitro on clonal macro-tumorospheres, as well as in vivo in glioblastoma mouse models. Our work further suggests that bisacodyl acts through inhibition of Ca[28109792]Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor.

Whether metabolic variations can drive this heterogeneity by controlling dynamic changes in cell states is unknown. Metabolite profiling of human adult glioblastoma stem-like cells upon loss of their tumorigenicity revealed a switch in the catabolism of the GABA neurotransmitter toward enhanced production and secretion of its by-product GHB (4-hydroxybutyrate). This switch was driven by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) downregulation. Enhancing GHB levels via SSADH downregulation or GHB supplementation triggered cell conversion into a less aggressive phenotypic state. GHB affected adult glioblastoma cells with varying molecular profiles, along with cells from pediatric pontine gliomas. In all cell types, GHB acted by inhibiting α-ketoglutarate-dependent Ten-eleven Translocations (TET) activity, resulting in decreased levels of the 5-hydroxymethylcytosine epigenetic mark. In patients, low SSADH expression was correlated with high GHB/α-ketoglutarate ratios, and distinguished weakly proliferative/differentiated glioblastoma territories from proliferative/non-differentiated territories. Our findings support an active participation of metabolic variations in the genesis of tumor heterogeneity.[28032215]Cell populations with differing proliferative, stem-like and tumorigenic states co-exist in most tumors and especially malignant gliomas.

Considering the common heterogeneity of cancer cells, the imbalanced regulatory mechanism could be switched on/off and contribute to drug resistance. Moreover, the subpopulation of GBM cells was recently discovered to share similar phenotypes with neural stem cells. These cancer stem cells (CSCs) promote the potency of tumor initiation. As a result, targeting of glioma stem cells has become the dominant way of improving the therapeutic outcome against GBM and extending the life span of patients. Among the biomarkers of CSCs, CD-133 (prominin-1) has been known to effectively isolate CSCs from cancer population, including GBM; however, the underlying mechanism of how stemness genes manipulate CSC-associated phenotypes, such as tumor initiation and relapse, is still unclear.\\nMETHODS: Tumorigenicity, drug resistance and embryonic stem cell markers were examined in primary CD133-positive (CD133(+)) GBM cells and CD133(+) subpopulation. Stemness signature of CD133(+) GBM cells was identified using microarray analysis. Stem cell potency, tumorigenicity and drug resistance were also tested in differential expression of SOX2 in GBM cells.\\nRESULTS: In this study, high tumorigenic and drug resistance was noticed in primary CD-133(+) GBM cells; meanwhile, plenty of embryonic stem cell markers were also elevated in the CD-133+\\xa0subpopulation. Using microarray analysis, we identified SOX2 as the most enriched gene among the stemness signature in CD133(+) GBM cells. Overexpression of SOX2 consistently enhanced the stem cell potency in the GBM cell lines, whereas knockdown of SOX2 dramatically withdrew CD133 expression in CD133(+) GBM cells. Additionally, we silenced SOX2 expression using RNAi system, which abrogated the ability of tumor initiation as well as drug resistance of CD133(+) GBM cells, suggesting that SOX2 plays a crucial role in regulating tumorigenicity in CD133(+) GBM cells.\\nCONCLUSION: SOX2 plays a crucial role in regulating tumorigenicity in CD133(+) GBM cells. Our results not only revealed the genetic plasticity contributing to drug resistance and stemness but also demonstrated the dominant role of SOX2 in maintenance of GBM CSCs, which may provide a novel therapeutic target to overcome the conundrum of poor survival of brain cancers.[27530866]BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal type of adult brain cancer and performs outrageous growth and resistance regardless of adjuvant chemotherapies, eventually contributing to tumor recurrence and poor outcomes.

CSCs display the malignant phenotype, self-renewal ability, altered genomic stability, specific epigenetic signature, and most of the time can be phenotyped by cell surface markers (e.g., CD133, CD24, and CD44). Numerous studies support the concept that non-stem cancer cells (non-CSCs) are sensitive to cancer therapy while CSCs are relatively resistant to treatment. In glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), there is clonal heterogeneity at the genetic level with distinct tumorigenic potential, and defined GSC marker expression resulting from clonal evolution which is likely to influence disease progression and response to treatment. Another level of complexity in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors is the dynamic equilibrium between GSCs and differentiated non-GSCs, and the potential for non-GSCs to revert (dedifferentiate) to GSCs due to epigenetic alteration which confers phenotypic plasticity to the tumor cell population. Moreover, exposure of the differentiated GBM cells to therapeutic doses of temozolomide (TMZ) or ionizing radiation (IR) increases the GSC pool both [26137500]Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or cancer initiating cells (CICs) maintain self-renewal and multilineage differentiation properties of various tumors, as well as the cellular heterogeneity consisting of several subpopulations within tumors.

It represents one of the deadliest human cancers, with an average survival at diagnosis of about 1 year. This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence after surgical removal. One of the most important hallmarks of GBM is tumor heterogeneity. Intertumor heterogeneity is mostly characterized by distinct genetic alterations that occur in individual tumors originating in the same organ and allows the classification of these tumors into different molecular subtypes. Intratumor heterogeneity-the diversity within individual tumors-has become the focus of research interest in the past few years, and tumor cell plasticity as a new source of cancer stem cells has added another level of complexity to this phenomenon. This review describes the molecular heterogeneity of GBMs at the transcriptome level and the expression profile-based classification of histopathologically indistinguishable tumors into different subtypes. In addition, the role of dedifferentiation of tumor cells into a stem cell-like state is discussed as a source of cellular heterogeneity within tumors, highlighting tumor cell plasticity as an important driver of GBM heterogeneity. Understanding tumor heterogeneity will help design better therapies against GBM and avoid tumor recurrence.[25404148]Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant type of primary brain tumor.

The current study investigated the anti-brain cancer potential of 50% ethanolic extract of\\xa0Tinospora cordifolia\\xa0(TCE) using C6 glioma cells. TCE significantly reduced cell proliferation in dose-dependent manner and induced differentiation in C6 glioma cells, resulting in astrocyte-like morphology as indicated by phase contrast images, GFAP expression and process outgrowth data of TCE treated cells which exhibited higher number and longer processes than untreated cells. Reduced proliferation of cells was accompanied by enhanced expression of senescence marker, mortalin and its translocation from perinuclear to pancytoplasmic spaces. Further, TCE showed anti-migratory and anti-invasive potential as depicted by wound scratch assay and reduced expression of plasticity markers NCAM and PSA-NCAM along with MMP-2 and 9. On analysis of the cell cycle and apoptotic markers, TCE treatment was seen to arrest the C6 cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phase, suppressing expression of G1/S phase specific protein cyclin D1 and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, thus supporting its anti-proliferative and apoptosis inducing potential. Present study provides the first evidence for the presence of anti-proliferative, differentiation-inducing and anti-migratory/anti-metastatic potential of TCE in glioma cells and possible signaling pathways involved in its mode of action.

The cellular heterogeneity of glioblastomas is manifest in genetic and epigenetic variation with both stochastic and hierarchical models informing cellular phenotypes. At the apex of the hierarchy is a self-renewing, tumorigenic, cancer stem cell (CSC). The significance of CSCs is underscored by their resistance to cytotoxic therapies, invasive potential, and promotion of angiogenesis. Thus, targeting CSCs may offer therapeutic benefit and sensitize tumors to conventional treatment, demanding elucidation of CSC regulation. Attention has been paid to intrinsic cellular systems in CSCs, but recognition of extrinsic factors is evolving. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are enriched in functional niches--prominently the perivascular space and hypoxic regions. These niches provide instructive cues to maintain GSCs and induce cellular plasticity towards a stem-like phenotype. GSC-maintaining niches may therefore offer novel therapeutic targets but also signal additional complexity with perhaps different pools of GSCs governed by different molecular mechanisms that must be targeted for tumor control.[21827414]Glioblastomas are highly lethal cancers for which conventional therapies provide only palliation.
